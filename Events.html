			<h1>Spectra Workshop: Identifying Best Practices Fostering Inclusion and Retention of LGBTQ Mathematicians</h1>
			<h2>Wednesday, April 6, 4:30–6:00 PM Pacific</h2>

		</hgroup>
		</header>
		<p>
			Organized by Ron Buckmire, Occidental College, Chris Goff, University of the Pacific, and Alexander Hoover, University of Akron. <br /><br />
			
			The goal of this interactive workshop is to gather and share information about and suggestions for best practices that foster the inclusion and retention of LGBTQ mathematicians. Specifically, this workshop will identify specific things any department of Mathematics can do to be supportive and welcoming for LGBTQ graduate students, postdocs as well as for tenured and non-tenured faculty. Panelists are 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ron Buckmire, Occidental College,</li>
				<li>Amanda Folsom, Amherst College,</li>
				<li>Joseph Nakao, University of Delaware, and</li> 
				<li>Keri Sather-Wagstaff, Clemson University.</li>
			</ul><p>
	In the second part of the Meeting, the audience will be asked to brainstorm and make suggestions on how Spectra can contribute to make these best practices known to the mathematical community and to help departments implement these best practices. During the workshop, the audience will be split into breakout sessions focused on specific topics, such as:
	<ul>
		<li>Supporting transgender mathematicians in the work place,</li>
		<li>LGBTQ mathematicians balancing work choices with family,</li>
		<li>Best practices for recruitment of LGBTQ faculty,</li>
		<li>Supporting LGBTQ graduate students.</li>
	</ul>

			<h1>Wikipedia Edit-A-Thon</h1>
			<h2>Wednesday, April 6, 12:30 - 5:00PM Eastern</h2>
		</hgroup>
		</header>
		<p>
			Keri Sather Wagstaff, Marie Vitulli, and Ursula Whitcher are hosting a Wikipedia Edit-a-thon to improve profiles of LGBTQ+ mathematicians on Wikipedia. <br /><br />

Date: Wednesday, April 6, 2022<br />
Time: 12:30 - 5:00 pm  Eastern(dropping in is fine!)<br />
Place: On the web (details will be posted on our Meetup page) <br /><br />

More information can be found on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/Spectra/Spectra_at_JMM_2022">Meetup page</a> for the event, which gives and provides links to helpful information. <br /><br />

The organizers have created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScChFwNLSL32IfdmnjQR3KN0615GFZV5tEM9EbP9ThSYXo78g/viewform">Google form</a> to gather information, including the opportunity to nominate yourself or someone else for a profile on Wikipedia and to ask if you want to be identified as an LGBTQ+ mathematician if someone creates a Wikipedia profile of you.  This information will be kept private.  No one will see it other than the Edit-a-thon organizers.  Only a handful of LGBTQ+ mathematicians have been nominated for pages.  It would be super helpful if you would nominate someone, including yourself if you meet the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(academics)">Wikipedia “Prof Test”</a>.

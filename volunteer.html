        <h1>Get Involved!</h1>
    </header>
    <p>In order to better serve and support the LGBTQ+ math community, the board has beenworking hard to reorganize and formalize various parts of Spectra. While this is a large andongoing project, we are excited to announce the formation of a number of newcommittees! In codifying these changes we hope to create new and easier ways forindividuals to become involved with and shape the future of Spectra. <br /><br />
    
If you are interested in joining any of the committees described below please feel free to reach out to the appropriate committee chair or complete this <a href="https://forms.gle/83Zn1VsumvM1jbQc6">GoogleForm</a></p>

            <h1>Membership Committee</h1>
            <h2>Chair: Joseph Nakao</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            Spectra's MembershipCommittee is calling for volunteers to help with ongoing and future projects thatpromote visibility and community of LGBTQ+ mathematicians. Such projectsinclude: visibility campaigns highlighting LGBTQ+ mathematicians, receptions atconferences (e.g., JMM), and brainstorming ways to further connect people in ourcommunity.

            <h1>Profession Committee</h1>
            <h2>Chair: Chris Goff</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            The main charge of Spectra’sProfession Committee is to support the professional development of LGBTQ+mathematicians and our inclusion in the larger community of professionalmathematicians. In the past, this has fallen into two big categories: facilitatingworkshops and panel discussions at the JMM, and organizing conferences forLGBTQ+ mathematicians. If you have interest or experience in planning or runningthese kinds of activities or have ideas for other ways to support the professionaldevelopment of LGBTQ+ math folks, please consider self-nominating for theProfession Committee.

            <h1>Outreach &amp; Communications Committee</h1>
            <h2>Chair: Alexander Hoover</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            The focus of Spectra’s Outreach and Communications Committee is keeping LGBTQ+mathematicians updated about any events and initiatives that can help furtherinclusive spaces in mathematics. This can entail overseeing Spectra’s onlinepresence on social media, creating campaigns to increase the visibility of LGBTQ+mathematicians, developing the newsletter to keep members informed about what’shappening in the LGBTQ+ Math and STEM community, and through other eventsand activities to engage a wide swatch of the mathematics community. We arelooking for community members that are willing to work together to brainstormnew outreach initiatives, as well as further the scope of this newsletter.

            <h1>Political Committee</h1>
            <h2>Chair: Keri Sather-Wagstaff</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            The focus of Spectra'sPolitical Committee is to advocate for a just and inclusive community for LGBTQ+people in the mathematical community, and beyond. This will include advocacy onbehalf of community members under political threat, discrimination, or persecutionfrom state and national governments, e.g., through statements ofsupport/condemnation and advocating for safe environments for conferences. Thecommittee will also continue Spectra's ongoing work to advocate for trans-inclusivepublication name policies.

            <h1>Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (EDIA) Committee</h1>
            <h2>Chair: Alex Wiedemann</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            Recognizing the importance of intersectionality, the focus of the EDI committee isto help support mathematicians along all axes of identity. A key component isensuring that Spectra as an organization is mindful of EDI issues in its decisions andcommunications. The EDI committee will be involved in many of the projects listedin the other committee descriptions, providing meaningful feedback to ensureSpectra is always striving to act more justly and improve its impact. Please considerself-nominating for this committee if you have experience or interest in thiscontinued work.

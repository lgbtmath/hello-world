    <p>Hi! I'm Andrew Bernoff, an applied mathematician whose research specializes in bridging the gaps between Mathematics, Physics, Biology and Engineering with a particular emphasis on using dynamical systems methods to understand experiments and natural phenomena.  I was an undergraduate at MIT and received my PhD at the University of Cambridge.  I've spent time on the faculty at Northwestern, Duke and the University of California at Berkeley before settling in at Harvey Mudd College, where I am the Kenneth & Diana Jonsson Professor of Mathematics and past chair of the Mathematics Department. I have been out and politically active since getting my PhD in the 80's. At Northwestern I spearheaded the effort to get domestic partner benefits in the 90's. At Harvey Mudd College I have been involved in many efforts to promote diversity, inclusion and equity.</p>

    <p>Hi, I'm Chris Goff.  I work at University of the Pacific in Stockton, California, where I've been since 2002.  I'm now a Professor in the math department and half-time Assistant Provost for Diversity.  My PhD was from UC Santa Cruz in 1999, and was about representation theory of certain Hopf and quasi-Hopf algebras.  I then completed a three-year teaching Postdoc at the University of Arizona before taking the job at Pacific.</p>

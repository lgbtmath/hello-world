        <p>
            As part of the cross-discipline trans inclusive name policy discord, we are working to push publishers to adopt name and name change policies that seamlessly allow mathematicians to change their publications to their lived names. A general guiding document was published as a guest editorial for the Committee on Ethics in Publishing:

        <p>
            Spectra is proud to announce that the first <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/spectra-math-conference/home">Spectra Conference</a> will occur this summer (August 18-20, 2021). Spectra is organizing this conference to provide opportunities for LGBTQ+ mathematicians both to celebrate achievements and to spark conversations of challenges in our community and the role Spectra can play. This will be a space for attendees to share their research across all areas of mathematics (theoretical, applied, and math education) and to interact and create support networks within and across their research communities. Stay tuned for more details!

    <p>Hi! I'm Andrew Bernoff, an applied mathematician whose research specializes in bridging the gaps between Mathematics, Physics, Biology and Engineering with a particular emphasis on using dynamical systems methods to understand experiments and natural phenomena.  I was an undergraduate at MIT and received my PhD at the University of Cambridge.  I've spent time on the faculty at Northwestern, Duke and the University of California at Berkeley before settling in at Harvey Mudd College, where I am the Kenneth &amp; Diana Jonsson Professor of Mathematics and past chair of the Mathematics Department. I have been out and politically active since getting my PhD in the 80's. At Northwestern I spearheaded the effort to get domestic partner benefits in the 90's. At Harvey Mudd College I have been involved in many efforts to promote diversity, inclusion and equity.</p>

    <p>Robert Bryant is a Professor of Mathematics at Duke University whose research work is mostly in differential geometry and geometric methods in partial differential equations.  A North Carolina native, he received his B.S. from NC State and his Ph.D. from UNC Chapel Hill in 1979.  His first academic position was at Rice University, and he moved to Duke in 1987, but spent six years at UC Berkeley (2007—2013) while he was director of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute.  He has served the mathematics community in numerous capacities during his career, including a term as AMS President.  He has been active in diversity and inclusion issues since the early 80s.  He was part of a faculty group who, in 1995, helped Duke become the first university in the South to offer same-sex domestic partner benefits.  After a 28-year engagement, he and his partner married in 2008.</p>
